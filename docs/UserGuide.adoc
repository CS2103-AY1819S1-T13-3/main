== Introduction

JxMusic is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for listening to music*. More importantly, JxMusic is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JxMusci can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `jxmusic.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JxMusic player.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`playlist list`* : lists all playlists
* **`playlist new`**`p/playlist1` : creates a new playlist named `playlist1` to the JxMusic Player.
* *`shuffle`* : switches on shuffle mode to play tracks in random order
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
