== Summary of contributions
* https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=handshou[*Code contributed*]
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage playlist by adding and deleting tracks*
** What it does: allows the user to add or remove tracks. Adding tracks is done in two ways. Firstly, by using index of the track in the panel. Otherwise, by using the track's name. Multiple tracks can be added in one line of command, by track index or track name. Deleting tracks are done by referencing tracks in the playlist card.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability of playlists because a user can initiate multiple tracks into a playlist with one line of command. Tracks can be be deleted too.
** Highlights: The implementation of adding and deleting tracks extend beyond commands, into model, playlist and track.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added *playlist*, *track* and *model* methods.
